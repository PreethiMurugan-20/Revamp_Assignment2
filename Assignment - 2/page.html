    <h1> Nano Car</h1>
    <p>The Tata Nano is a city car/microcar manufactured and marketed by Indian automaker Tata Motors over a single generation from 2008–2018, primarily in India, as an inexpensive rear-engine hatchback for motorcycle and scooter drivers — with a launch price of ₹100,000 (US$2,500 ) on 10 January 2008.[5]</p>

    <p> <strong>History Of Car</strong> </p>
    <p>After successfully launching the low cost Tata Ace truck in 2005, Tata Motors began development of an affordable passenger car that would appeal to the many Indians who ride motorcycles.[12] The purchase price of this no frills auto was brought down by dispensing with most nonessential features, reducing the amount of steel used in its construction, and relying on low cost Indian labour.[citation needed]. The design featured only a driver's side wing mirror, one wiper blade, only three lug nuts per wheel and a fuel tank without filler cap.[13] Tata said it was the first time a 2-cylinder petrol engine was being used in a car with single balancer shaft.
        At introduction the Nano received attention due to its low price of 1 lakh rupees (Rs. 100,000).[14] Some promotional material labeled the vehicle as "The People’s Car".[15]</p>
